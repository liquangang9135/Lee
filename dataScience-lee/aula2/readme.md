### Mean (média)

### Mode (moda)

### Median (mediana)

### Quartiles (quartis) and Percentiles (percentis)

Quartiles divides data in 4 parts. These are indicated by $Q1$, $Q2$, $Q3$, such as $Q2$ is the median

The same rationale can be applied to percentiles, that divides the data in each 1% from $P1 \dots P99$

### Variance (variância)

the variance quantifies how distance each value is from the mean. The smaller the variance, the closer values are from the mean. 

$$Var(X)=\frac{\Sigma_ {i=1}^{n}(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}$$

$x$ is the mean and $n$ is sample size 

### Standard deviantion (desvio padrão)

the standard deviation provides an "error" rate of a dataset if the values are replaced by the mean

$$\overline{x}\plusmn\sigma$$

$$\sigma=\sqrt{Var(X)}$$

### Assymetry

Compares the distribution to a gaussian distribution

* when mean, median, mode match the distribution is symetric and symmetry coefficient is zero
* when the mean is greater than median and mode, 

### Kurstosis

Computes the "tailedness" of a distribution
